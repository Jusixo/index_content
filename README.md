# RESTful API to index a pages content.

Goal is to "parse the page content and store it's content - in this case to store the content that is found inside the tags h1, h2 and h3 and the links.""

## Although you have freedom to show your skills, the requirements below must be fulfilled:

*Your code must be written in Ruby / Ruby on Rails*
*The API must have at least two endpoints:
*One that receives a url and indexes the content
*One that lists previously stored urls

## endpoints:

*One endpoint should receive the URL of the page, grab it's content and store it's content with the tags h1, h2 and h3 and the links
*The other endpoint should list the urls and content stored in the database
*The API must store only content
*Inside html header tags (H1, H2 and H3)
*Links urls
